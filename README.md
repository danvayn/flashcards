# FlashCards README

This is Project #3 of the Udacity React Developer nanodegree. It is a simple app used to organize decks of notecards. It features

- a path to quiz yourself on the cards in your deck

- a daily reminder to take a quiz (with your permission of course)

- animated card flipping to give you that real index card experience.

- actionsheets to give additional deck options and generate fake decks for you.

- complete parity between iOS and Android thanks to [CRNA](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) and native-base.

To start the project, simply cd in, yarn install and yarn start to start the app. NPM may be used in place of yarn but this has not been tested and at the moment is likely to not work.
